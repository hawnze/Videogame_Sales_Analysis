Data Analysis with Video Games Sales (1980 - ~2015) using SQL --> Power BI Project


Raw Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/video-game-sales-analyze

"This dataset provides a comprehensive list of video games with sales exceeding 100,000 copies. The data was collected through web scraping from vgchartz.com, ensuring a robust compilation of sales figures for various games across multiple regions and platforms."
From 1980 - 2015 (Not enough data from 2017 - 2020)

Disclaimer: This data is scraped from the website: vgchartz.com
VGChartz data typically only includes games that are soldâ€”meaning it generally excludes free-to-play games. Also, the data typically focuses on commercially sold games, meaning games that require purchase and have measurable sales figures. So games that many are familiar with like Fortnite, League of Legends, etc. are not going to be part of this as games with microtransactions and in game purchases are those games' main source of revenue

The reason I wanted to do a project on this is because I enjoy playing video games as a hobby and they have only recently started become popular / mainstream in the early 2000s and has now become even more common in our society today because of the new capabilities that consoles have now compared to before.

This is my favorite project by far as I was passionate about the date I was working on
